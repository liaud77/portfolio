# 1. Project Overview
## 1.1 Yeeyan Gutenberg Project
[Yeeyan Gutenberg project](http://g.yeeyan.com/) is a translation platform initialized by Beijing YeeyanXieli Technology Co., Ltd. Yeeyan Gutenberg Project (hereinafter referred to as "Yeeyan") translates open-source books (e.g. public domain books, and Creative Commons licensed works). Translated books will be published in digital format first, and active efforts will be made to find suitable opportunities for physical publication. Project manager and translators will receive a share of the sales (from e-books) and royalties (from physical books).
## 1.2 English-Chinese translation of *The Daughter of Time*
*The Daughter of Time* is a historical mystery novel by Josephine Tey. Since its first publication in 1951, it has been consistently ranked among the greatest mystery novels of all time, cementing its place in the literary canon. In 1990, the Crime Writers' Association voted it number one on their list of the *Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time*, and in 1995, the Mystery Writers of America placed it fourth on their list of the *Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time*.
The objective of this translation project is to produce a high-quality Chinese translation of *The Daughter of Time* that retains the novel's literary integrity, historical authenticity, and overall appeal to the target audience. The translation should accurately convey the nuances of the original text, including the characters' voices, the author's style, and the historical context.

- When uploading your translation in the Yeeyan editor, put the number and title of the chapter under the "Title" column. Your translated chapter title can not be the same as the original title. 
- You have to finish self-revision of your translated work within a day.

## 3.3 Group-revision
