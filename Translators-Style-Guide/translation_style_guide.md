# 1. Annotation
Provide annotations whenever there is content related to history, geography, culture, religion, customs, or life habits that may be unfamiliar or not understood by most Chinese readers. 

Annotations should be placed at the end of the chapter, using sequential numbering that restarts with each new chapter. The annotations should be as concise as possible. To facilitate proofreading and typesetting, please strictly follow the following format for annotations:

Within the translated text, add English square brackets and numbers at the end of the word or sentence requiring annotation. At the end of the chapter, add English square brackets [ ], followed by the number and the annotation.

Example:

In-text:

During a break at the TED conference in February 2007, I had a conversation with Chris Anderson[2], the current editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, about his new book *Free*.

End of chapter:

[2] Chris Anderson: Since 2001, he has served as the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine in the United States and has published works such as *The Long Tail* and *Free: The Future of a Radical Price*.

# 2. Formatting
Preserve in the translated text the corresponding formats that the author intentionally used in the original text, as they carry specific meanings and functions. Below are the instructions for handling specific formats in translation.
## 2.1 Font
When there are various font changes and combinations in the source text, it is advisable to use the corresponding fonts in the translated text. Below are two exceptions.
### 2.1.1 Italics in source text
1. In Chinese translation, use angle brackets 《》 and normal text inside the brackets for the publication titles, even if they are formatted in italics in the original text.  
2. In Chinese translation, use quotation marks "" and normal text inside the quotation marks for song titles, even if they are formatted in italics in the original text. 
### 2.1.2 Capitals in source text
1. In Chinese translation, use bold font and normal text for all capital words in the original text. 
2. For terms such as the names of institutions or organizations that are specifically capitalized in the original text, use normal font in translation.
## 2.2 Font size, line spacing, and starting a new page
Preserve as much as possible the original text's changes in font size, line spacing, and starting a new page for both chapter titles and within the main text.
## 2.3 Spaces
Preserve as much as possible the following formats in the original text:
- left or right indentations in paragraphs;
- intentional irregular arrangements in poetry (distinguished from line breaks);
- intentional spaces or line breaks in the main text.

**NB: Due to the ongoing debate in the translation and publishing industry regarding whether to conform to the English or Chinese conventions, you are free to choose either approach. However, a consistent approach must be chosen and applied within a project.**
# 4. Personal and place names
Follow the guidelines provided by the reference books below. In cases where the entry cannot be found e.g. the original names are invented by the author, use the transliteration rules outlined in these books. 

**NB: Use established translations for well-known figures and locations such as *Shakespeare* and *Times Square*.**

1. Follow *English Names Translation Handbook (China Commercial Press, 2018)* for the translation of English personal names; *World Names Translation Dictionary (China Translation Corporation, 1993)* for the translation of personal names in other languages. 
2. Follow *American Place Names Dictionary (China Commercial Press, 2000)* for the translation of place names in America; *Dictionary of World Place Names (Encyclopedia of China Publishing House, 1984)* for the translation of place names in other countries. 
# 5. Numbers
- Use Arabic numerals for numbers that represent time, e.g. century, year, month, day, hour, minute, second.
- Use Arabic numerals for numbers no greater than 10, use Chinese characters for numbers bigger than 10. However, use only Arabic numerals when numbers smaller and bigger than 10 appear in the text together.  
- Use Chinese characters to describe a number range. But when the range is bigger than one hundred and has a specific reference number, use Arabic numerals. 
-  In numbers bigger than 10 000, use Chinese characters "万" and "亿"to replace the unit "10 000" and "100 000 000".
-  Add a space between every three digits, e.g. "4 500 seconds", "54 000 units". 
# 6. References
- Follow the guidelines provided by *English-Chinese Dictionary (Shanghai Translation Publishing House, 2005)* when translate English-Chinese text. 
- Follow the standardization outlined in *Contemporary Chinese Dictionary (Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 2005)* to avoid any misusage in Chinese.
