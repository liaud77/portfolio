格兰特躺在一架白色的折叠床上，嫌恶地盯着天花板。他能认出这块干净整洁的天花板上的每一条裂缝。天花板是格兰特在心里规划出的一片土地，他为它制定地图，神游在山川与陆岛之间；天花板也是他的探宝之地，他一个人既出谜又解谜，探出其间隐藏的神秘面庞和飞鸟游鱼；这天花板对他而言还是一道算术题，求出的解是他的童年回忆，他的人生信条、上下求索和交往关系 [注：这三个词在英文中均可用作数学术语]。除了恨恨地盯着这块天花板，他根本无事可干。

格兰特想让护士“袖珍人”为他调整一下床的方向，好让他有一块新的天花板可以“探索”，但这种调整似乎会破坏整个房间的协调美感。要知道，在医院里最重要的是卫生，紧随其后的就是协调感，这比敬虔还重要。不协调的摆置在医院里就如同渎神。“袖珍人”问格兰特，他的朋友不停地在给他带书，还全是些售价昂贵、包装精美的新书，为什么不读读呢？

“这世上的文字就像人口一样在爆发，媒体每分每秒向外输出数百万计的文字，多可怕呀，我才不想去读。”格兰特说。

“真是阴阳怪气的。”“袖珍人”对他说。

护士“袖珍人”名叫英厄姆，她身高1米58，比例匀称，外形对得起她的绰号。格兰特看她就跟一只德累斯顿 [注：东德一城市] 瓷器似的，若非卧病在床，他能单手把她举起来。给她取个“袖珍人”的绰号是因为不满她对自己颐指气使。光是规定他这个成年人能干什么、不能干什么也就算了，面对他1米8几的身高，她那“举重若轻”的态度才是最让格兰特觉得丢人的。很显然，体型和重量差距对于“袖珍人”来说不算什么，她处理床垫就像转盘子一样游刃有余，床垫于她轻若无物。和“袖珍人”换班的另一位护士绰号是“女武士”，因为这位美女的手臂就像山毛榉的树枝一样修长。“女武士”名叫达罗尔，来自格洛斯特郡 [注：英国英格兰郡名]，每到春天水仙花花季时就会特别想家（“袖珍人”的家乡在利瑟姆圣安斯，那里可没有“水仙花开，几多乡愁”这种玩意儿）。“女武士”的手大且柔软，一双明眸温柔动人，对病人总是充满悲悯。但稍微一干体力活儿，她就喘得像个抽吸泵机。总体来说，比起“袖珍人”视他的体重轻若鸿毛，“女武士”搞得他仿佛重如泰山的样子更让格兰特觉得丢人。

格兰特之所以在这儿卧床养病，受这二位护士的照顾，是因为他从一扇活板门掉了下去。对他而言这才是最最丢人的事情，相比之下护士们对待他的方式以及他的体重到底看上去如何根本算不上什么。从一扇活板门掉下去简直是世上最荒谬可笑的事情。格兰特入院后，他对嫌犯本尼·斯科尔的全力追捕也搁置了。所幸的是本尼很快就落入了威廉姆斯队长的手里，也算给了处于如此窘境的格兰特一丝安慰。

Grant lay on his high white cot and stared at the ceiling. Stared at it with loathing. He knew by heart every last minute crack on its nice clean surface. He had made maps of the ceiling and gone exploring on them; rivers, islands, and continents. He had made guessing games of it and discovered hidden objects; faces, birds, and fishes. He had made mathematical calculations of it and rediscovered his childhood; theorems, angles, and triangles. There was practically nothing else he could do but look at it. He hated the sight of it.

He had suggested to The Midget that she might turn his bed round a little so that he could have a new patch of ceiling to explore. But it seemed that that would spoil the symmetry of the room, and in hospitals symmetry ranked just a short head behind cleanliness and a whole length in front of Godliness. Anything out of the parallel was hospital profanity. Why didn’t he read? she asked. Why didn’t he go on reading some of those expensive brand-new novels that his friends kept on bringing him.

‘There are far too many people born into the world, and far too many words written. Millions and millions of them pouring from the presses every minute. It’s a horrible thought.’

‘You sound constipated,’ said The Midget.

The Midget was Nurse Ingham, and she was in sober fact a very nice five- feet two, with everything in just proportion. Grant called her The Midget to compensate himself for being bossed around by a piece of Dresden china which he could pick up in one hand. When he was on his feet, that is to say. It was not only that she told him what he might or might not do, but she dealt with his six-feet-odd with an off-hand ease that Grant found humiliating. Weights meant nothing, apparently, to The Midget. She tossed mattresses around with the absent-minded grace of a plate spinner. When she was off-duty he was attended to by The Amazon, a goddess with arms like the limb of a beech tree. The Amazon was Nurse Darroll, who came from Gloucestershire and was homesick each daffodil season. (The Midget came from Lytham St Anne’s, and there was no daffodil nonsense about her.) She had large soft hands and large soft cow’s eyes and she always looked very sorry for you, but the slightest physical exertion set her breathing like a suction-pump. On the whole Grant found it even more humiliating to be treated as a dead weight than to be treated as if he was no weight at all.

Grant was bed-borne, and a charge on The Midget and The Amazon, because he had fallen through a trap-door. This, of course, was the absolute in humiliation; compared with which the heavings of The Amazon and the light slingings of The Midget were a mere corollary. To fall through a trap-door was the ultimate in absurdity; pantomimic, bathetic, grotesque. At the moment of his disappearance from the normal level of perambulation he had been in hot pursuit of Benny Skoll, and the fact that Benny had careered round the next corner slap into[Pg 9]the arms of Sergeant Williams provided the one small crumb of comfort in an intolerable situation.
